# 📚 Soojin's Learning Plan for Building a Practice Management Software

## 🗓️ Phase 1: Foundations of Web Development

### Goal: Build a solid understanding of core web technologies.

### Topics to Cover:

1. HTML & CSS:
  - Structure and style web pages.
  - Responsive design (Flexbox, Grid).
2. JavaScript Basics:
  - Variables, functions, loops, conditionals.
  - DOM manipulation.
3. Version Control (Git & GitHub):
  - Commit, branch, merge, pull requests.


### 🛠️ Project Milestone:
- Build a simple website with a homepage, contact form, and scheduling page.

### 🧠 Resources:

- FreeCodeCamp (HTML/CSS/JavaScript sections)
- MDN Web Docs
- GitHub Learning Lab


## 🗓️ Phase 2: Backend Development Basics
Goal: Learn server-side programming and databases.

Topics to Cover:
Backend Framework:
Learn a beginner-friendly backend framework: Node.js + Express (JavaScript) or Python + Flask/Django.
Databases:
Basics of SQL (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL).
Basics of NoSQL (e.g., MongoDB).
APIs:
RESTful API design.
How to connect frontend and backend.
🛠️ Project Milestone:
Build a basic app that can:
Store and retrieve patient data in a database.
Handle simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.
🧠 Suggested Resources:

The Odin Project (Backend Module)
Node.js Documentation
SQLBolt (SQL Basics)
🗓️ Phase 3: Build Key Features Inspired by Cliniko
Goal: Develop each core feature of the practice management software incrementally.

🚀 Feature 1: Appointment Scheduling System
Build a calendar system with day, week, and month views.
Allow booking and editing appointments.
Integrate a notification/reminder system.
🛠️ Learning Topics:

JavaScript date libraries (e.g., Moment.js, Luxon).
Calendar APIs (e.g., FullCalendar.js).
📝 Feature 2: Patient Record Management
Design a system to store and retrieve treatment notes.
Enable uploading and managing files (e.g., PDFs, images).
Implement user authentication and secure access.
🛠️ Learning Topics:

File upload APIs.
Authentication systems (e.g., JWT, OAuth).
Data encryption and security best practices.
💳 Feature 3: Invoice and Payment System
Design invoice templates and integrate them into patient records.
Track payments and outstanding balances.
Integrate payment gateways (e.g., Stripe, PayPal).
🛠️ Learning Topics:

Stripe API for payments.
PDF generation (e.g., jsPDF).
Financial calculations and tax handling.
📋 Feature 4: Custom Patient Questionnaire Form
Create a dynamic form builder.
Store form responses securely.
Integrate responses into patient records.
🛠️ Learning Topics:

Form handling libraries (e.g., Formik, React Hook Form).
Backend form validation.
✅ Project Milestone:
A functional MVP (Minimum Viable Product) with core features implemented.
🧠 Suggested Resources:

Moment.js Documentation
FullCalendar.js Guide
Stripe API Docs
Formik Documentation
🗓️ Phase 4: Advanced Topics and Deployment
Goal: Improve software quality, usability, and scalability.

Topics to Cover:
Frontend Frameworks:
React.js or Vue.js for dynamic interfaces.
Deployment:
Hosting (e.g., Vercel, Netlify for frontend; AWS, Heroku for backend).
Testing:
Unit and Integration testing (e.g., Jest, Mocha).
Security and Compliance:
HIPAA compliance (if storing health data).
Data encryption and secure storage.
✅ Project Milestone:
Deploy the practice management software to a live environment.
Conduct user testing with a small group of patients.
🧠 Suggested Resources:

React.js Official Docs
Heroku Deployment Guide
OWASP Web Security Guide
🗓️ Phase 5: Continuous Improvement and Iteration
Gather feedback from users.
Optimize performance and usability.
Add advanced features like analytics, automated reminders, and patient portals.
🧠 Mindset and Habits for Success:
Consistency: Dedicate 1-2 hours per day to learning.
Projects First: Apply concepts by building small modules.
Community: Join developer communities (e.g., Stack Overflow, Reddit).
Iterate: Start simple and add complexity gradually.
