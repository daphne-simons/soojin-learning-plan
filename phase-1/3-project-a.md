# Phase 1 - Section 3

## Project - part a): 
Build basic Skeleton for Phase 1 project 

### Description:
Using your basic knowledge of HTMl, the command line, and git and github, you will create a basic skeleton repo for your phase 1 project.
You will continue to add to this project after you learn more about CSS, and again when you learn more about JavaScript.

- in Github, setup a new repo and call it 'phase1-project' 

- Create a folder in your computer where you will keep all of your coding projects. Using your terminal, `cd` into this folder, and then `git clone` the repo that you just created. 
- `cd` into this git repo, and then `code .` to open your project in VSCode. 

- Once in VScode, create a new index.html file and include the following code: 

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>Soojin's Phase 1 Project</title>
</head>
<body>
  
</body>
</html>
```

- Save your changes, and `git add .`, `git commit -m "add index.html"` and `git push origin main` to push your changes up to github. If all goes well, you should be able to see your changes on your github repo in the browser.

- Next, back in VSCode, in your `index.html` file, create a heading for your page and do another `git add .`, `git commit -m "add heading", and `git push origin main`. 

- This is all for now, you have created the basic skeleton for your phase 1 project. You will be adding more to this project as you learn more about CSS and JavaScript.
