# Section 0: Install Software and Set up Computer

1. You will need a command line tool app, For Mac computers, you can use `Terminal` (you probably already have it on your laptop)

2. You will need to a code editor, I recommend downloading and using Visual Studio Code: 
- [Download VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

3. You will need to install Git on your computer to use Github. 
- [ ] Create an account on Github
- [ ] Install Git on your computer
- [ ] Create and add a github ssh key to your computer 
- [ ] Test cloning a repo, making changes, commiting your changes and adding it back to Github. 

Have a go at doing these steps, but if you get stuck, you can always refer to the:
